# Tune-Up
Tune Up is an exhibit located in gadgets. Kids use a floor plate, representing pistons in an engine, to play notes on a scale. They must find the correct order to play Do-Re-Mi. This project uses an Arduino Mega, a Sparkfun WAV Trigger board, and an 8 channel relay card. The Mega recieves button presses from the floor pad. These presses in-turn light up a given note and play the corresponding note. The trigger board uses active inputs to trigger playback of a track. The board supports polyphonic playback, allowing upto 14 tracks to be played at once. The relay card turns strips of LEDs on and of when a piston is pressed. The code can be changed to set the firing order differently.
